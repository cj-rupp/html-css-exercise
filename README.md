## HTML Accessibility Assignment.html

This is a file marked up in structured, semantic HTML. This reflects the structure of the document as described in the guideline document. Where relevant, accessibility issues have been considered. Initially, the contents were automatically converted to HTML, but the vestiges of that conversion have been subsequently removed and the HTML structure redesigned.

This folder also contains some auxiliary files:
- **README.md:** This file.
- **Web-Accessibility-1200x675.png:** The image for the article, recovered from Google Images.
- **tr_logo_purple .png:** \[sic\] The Tech Returners logo.
- **GoogleLighthouseReport.pdf** A saved summary of the Lighthouse report on the page.
- **package.json, package-lock.json, .htmlvalidate.json:** Assorted node auxiliary files.

The page has been check with HTML validation (in VSCode) and Lighthouse. I trust this will suffice.
